# CS532-Course-Project-Asteroids-Classification
For the astronomical observation, itâ€™s essential to develop an
efficient system to identify the hazard of the asteroids. Supervised learning is a good method to make
predictions based on the known data. In this project, three classic supervised learning models will be
applied: Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. Different methods will be
used for each algorithm. The effectiveness of the models will be evaluated. The major objective is to
find the best classifier to classify the potential asteroids as hazardous or non-hazardous. Finally, the
best method and strategy will be proposed for the future applications.
